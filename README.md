# Movies-ETL

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables for a hackathon utilizing Movie data. I refactored the code from a previous module to create one function that takes in three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
